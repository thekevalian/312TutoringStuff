<h1>TicTacToe and C++ Copy Assignment Operator and Copy Constructor </h1>

In order to run and play with this example on the linux server:
1. Login into the linux server 
2. git clone https://github.com/thekevalian/312TutoringStuff.git
3. cd 312TutoringStuff/ConstructorWithTicTacToe/
4. make

You will now have two executable files:
1. <b>cons_ex</b>
2. <b>tictactoe</b>

<b>cons_ex</b> will let you see when the constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator and destructor are called. You are free to modify the code starting at line 6 to understand what's going on.

<b>tictactoe</b> is just a simple tictactoe program
